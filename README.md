## Emiel van de Hoven (Post-doc)
#### Short Bio
From 2008-2011 I did a BA in Communication and Information Sciences at Tilburg University. After that, I did a Research Master’s in Language and Communication at Tilburg University and Radboud University Nijmegen. I wrote my MA thesis with Roel Willems at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, while also working at the MPI as a student-assistant for Elizabeth Norcliffe. In 2014, I started my PhD in Cognitive Science at the University of Freiburg under the supervision of Evelyn Ferstl. I successfully defended my doctoral thesis in February 2019 before moving to Potsdam to start as a Post-doc in Audrey Bürki’s Cognitive Science: Language and Methods lab.

#### Research Interests
I’m interested in a variety of topics related to language processing – my MA thesis was about the effect of the literary device of foregrounding on reading times; the topic of my PhD was how so-called implicit causality verbs and the larger discourse context affect discourse expectations and pronoun resolution; and currently I’m investigating the planning of utterances across languages with different linguistic constraints. Three common denominators of my work are the use of eye-tracking as a methodology; an interest in methods of statistical analysis; and an aim for conceptual clarity when talking about the mind.

## Sylvain Madec (Post-doc)





## Hyein Jeong (PhD student)
#### Short Bio
I'm a PhD student in the "Cognitive Science: Language and Methods lab" at the University of Potsdam, in Germany. I'm currently working on noun phrase production in German.




#### Research Interests
I am interested in how people comprehend and produce multi-word utterances, integrating different kinds of semantic information. Previously, I investigated the mechanism of sentence comprehension in Korean with a focus on semantic processing (e.g. homonymy, polysemy, metaphor) using ERPs and reaction time measures.

## Thea Villinger (PhD student)
#### Short Bio
I obtained a B.Sc. in Psychology in 2012, and a M.Sc. in Experimental Linguistics in 2017. I have worked as a research assistant in labs at Montana State University, and the University of Potsdam. I started my Ph.D. in 2017 in the "Cognitive Science: Language and Methods Lab" at the University of Potsdam under the supervision of Dr. Audrey Bürki. My Ph.D. project focuses on language production and EEG methodology.
 
#### Research Interests
My research interests lie in the field of cognitive science; how the brain produces language both in monolingual and multilingual speakers. I use various offline experiments (i.e. reaction time data, acoustic analysis) and online experiments (i.e. eye-tracking, event-related brain potentials) to investigate the cognitive processes underlying language production.

Education:  
Sept 2010 - June 2015: Diploma in Philology, Lomonosow Moscow State University, Russia (With Honours)  
Oct 2015 - May 2018: M.Sc. in Experimental and Clinical Linguistics, University of Potsdam, Germany (With Distinction)  
Sept 2018 - present: Ph.D. candidate within the IDEALAB Ph.D. programme (http://www.phd-idealab.com//)  

Employment history:    
July 2016 - June 2018: Research Assistant at the NOLA Lab, University of Potsdam (https://www.uni-potsdam.de/nola/index.html)  
March 2017 - August 2018: Research Assistant at the VasishthLab, University of Potsdam (http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/)   

#### Research interests
I am currently working on novel word learning in first and second language, and I am particularly interested in the impact of learning context on such aspects of word learning as explicit recall, semantic integration and between-language mapping. I aim to study this using both behavioral and electrophysiological methods. In addition, I have a keen interest in the role of memory and age-related processes in language learning. I am also very enthusiastic about statistics.
