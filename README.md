## Audrey Bürki

#### Short Bio
I obtained a PhD in Linguistics in 2010, then worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Universities of York, Geneva, and Marseille, and as a lecturer in Methodology and data analysis in Geneva. I arrived in Potsdam in October 2016 to start a research group with a focus on language and applied statistics. 

#### Research interests

My research combines a theoretical interest for the cognitive architecture of the language production system and a methodological interest for the paradigms and statistical tools that allow collecting and analyzing the relevant data. It combines theoretical models and methods from different fields, including linguistics (phonetic sciences, phonology), experimental psychology, statistics, and cognitive neurosciences (i.e., ERPs). I am particularly interested in inter-individual behavior.
Common underlying themes and goals in my research projects are (1) how to extend the description of language planning processes so that it accounts for language as it is spoken and learned in every day contexts (i.e., towards an ecological model of language production) (2) how to apply state-of-the-art tools in statistics to make the most of empirical data and (3) how to best describe and model the acquisition of new linguistic knowledge.

## Emiel van den Hoven (Post-doc)
#### Short Bio
From 2008-2011 I did a BA in Communication and Information Sciences at Tilburg University. After that, I did a Research Master’s in Language and Communication at Tilburg University and Radboud University Nijmegen. I wrote my MA thesis with Roel Willems at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, while also working at the MPI as a student-assistant for Elizabeth Norcliffe. In 2014, I started my PhD in Cognitive Science at the University of Freiburg under the supervision of Evelyn Ferstl. I successfully defended my doctoral thesis in February 2019 before moving to Potsdam to start as a Post-doc in Audrey Bürki’s Cognitive Science: Language and Methods lab.

#### Research Interests
I’m interested in a variety of topics related to language processing – my MA thesis was about the effect of the literary device of foregrounding on reading times; the topic of my PhD was how so-called implicit causality verbs and the larger discourse context affect discourse expectations and pronoun resolution; and currently I’m investigating the planning of utterances across languages with different linguistic constraints. Three common denominators of my work are the use of eye-tracking as a methodology; an interest in methods of statistical analysis; and an aim for conceptual clarity when talking about the mind.

## Pamela Fuhrmeister (Post-doc)
 
I finished my B.A. in German in 2009 and my M.A. in Applied Linguistics in 2011 at Texas Tech University. I received my PhD in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences in July 2020 from the University of Connecticut. I am now a postdoc in the Cognitive Science: Language and Methods lab, led by Dr. Audrey Bürki, and I am working on the SFB project B05, Variability and its limits in the time course of language production processes.

My research so far has focused on the perceptual learning of second-language speech sounds and how phonetic variability in the speech signal can affect learning and memory for those sounds. Another line of my work seeks to better understand individual differences in speech perception and learning of speech sounds by testing whether language ability, cognitive skills, or individual variation in brain structure (using MRI) predict individual differences in performance on perceptual speech tasks. I am now working on projects involving individual differences in cognitive skills and how these relate to word production.

## Hyein Jeong (PhD student)
#### Short Bio
I'm a PhD student in the "Cognitive Science: Language and Methods lab" at the University of Potsdam, in Germany. I'm currently working on noun phrase production in German.

#### Research Interests
I am interested in how people comprehend and produce multi-word utterances, integrating different kinds of semantic information. Previously, I investigated the mechanism of sentence comprehension in Korean with a focus on semantic processing (e.g. homonymy, polysemy, metaphor) using ERPs and reaction time measures.

## Maria Korochkina (PhD student)
#### Short bio  
I obtained a diploma in Philology in 2015 (Lomonosov Moscow State University) and a M.Sc. in Experimental and Clinical Linguistics in 2018 (University of Potsdam). During my master studies, I have worked as a research assistant in various projects at NOLA and Vasishth labs involving fNIRS, EEG and eye-tracking.

#### Research interests
I am currently working on novel word learning in first and second language, and I am particularly interested in the impact of learning context on such aspects of word learning as explicit recall, semantic integration and between-language mapping. I aim to study this using both behavioral and electrophysiological methods. In addition, I have a keen interest in the role of memory and age-related processes in language learning. I am also very enthusiastic about statistics.

## Shereen Elbuy (PhD Student)
#### Short bio  
In 2014 I obtained a B.A in Linguistics from Qatar University, and in 2019 I completed my M.Sc in Experimental and Clinical Linguistics at Universität Potsdam. Both of my theses mainly involved the investigation of word production in Arabic aphasia; specifically the role of different Arabic morphological properties during noun and verb retrieval. Upon completion of my M.Sc, I enrolled as a PhD candidate at the Cognitive Science: Language & Methods lab under the supervision of Audrey Bürki and Isabell Wartenburger. I am also recruited as a Research Assistant at the CSLM lab to assist with EEG and behavioural data collection and pre-processing, as well as in a meta-analysis of semantic interference effects in the picture word interference paradigm.

#### Research interests
I am interested in the role of language-specific features of Arabic on language production processes, more precisely I want to investigate the role of Arabic morphological properties during the semantic encoding of nouns in healthy speakers. I will do so using simple picture naming tasks and the Picture-Word-Interference (PWI) paradigm.
