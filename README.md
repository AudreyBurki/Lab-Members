## Sylvain Madec (Post-doc)


## Hyein Jeong (PhD student)
#### Short Bio
I'm a PhD student in the "Cognitive Science: Language and Methods lab" at the University of Potsdam, in Germany. I'm currently working on noun phrase production in German.

#### Research Interests
I am interested in how people comprehend and produce multi-word utterances, integrating different kinds of semantic information. Previously, I investigated the mechanism of sentence comprehension in Korean with a focus on semantic processing (e.g. homonymy, polysemy, metaphor) using ERPs and reaction time measures.

## Thea Villinger (PhD student)
#### Short Bio
I obtained a B.Sc. in Psychology in 2012, and a M.Sc. in Experimental Linguistics in 2017. I have worked as a research assistant in labs at Montana State University, and the University of Potsdam. I started my Ph.D. in 2017 in the "Cognitive Science: Language and Methods Lab" at the University of Potsdam under the supervision of Dr. Audrey BÃ¼rki. My Ph.D. project focuses on language production and EEG methodology.
 
#### Research Interests
My research interests lie in the field of cognitive science; how the brain produces language both in monolingual and multilingual speakers. I use various offline experiments (i.e. reaction time data, acoustic analysis) and online experiments (i.e. eye-tracking, event-related brain potentials) to investigate the cognitive processes underlying language production.

Education:  
Sept 2010 - June 2015: Diploma in Philology, Lomonosow Moscow State University, Russia (With Honours)  
Oct 2015 - May 2018: M.Sc. in Experimental and Clinical Linguistics, University of Potsdam, Germany (With Distinction)  
Sept 2018 - present: Ph.D. candidate within the IDEALAB Ph.D. programme (http://www.phd-idealab.com//)  

Employment history:  
July 2016 - June 2018: Research Assistant at the NOLA Lab, University of Potsdam (https://www.uni-potsdam.de/nola/index.html)  
March 2017 - August 2018: Research Assistant at the VasishthLab, University of Potsdam (http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/)  

#### Research interests
I am currently working on novel word learning in first and second language, and I am particularly interested in the impact of learning context on such aspects of word learning as explicit recall, semantic integration and between-language mapping. I aim to study this using both behavioral and electrophysiological methods. In addition, I have a keen interest in the role of memory and age-related processes in language learning. I am also very enthusiastic about statistics.
